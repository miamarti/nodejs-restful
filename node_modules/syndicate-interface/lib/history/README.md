Get the results for a set of completed jobs using mkue.
Assumes you have an index on `input.thing._id`.

This is only useful for getting single values at a time.
For something like votes where you might want multiple properties at the same time,
you might be better off writing custom queries (unless you want the whole thing).

# Example

```js
var history = require('./jobs')

// get the history of counts

history({
  thing: thing,
  collection: 'discussions.counts.jobs',
  name: 'discussions.parents',
}).on('data', function (result) {
  console.log(result._id) // the date
  console.log(result.value) // the count
})
```
